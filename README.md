# Radio-for-Audio
This repository includes a list of Radio Station Names and correspodning streaming URLs, plus additional information such as bitrate and format (when known).
The idea is to facilitate the addition of Radio Stations to Audio Distro or Tools such as Moode (http://www.moodeaudio.org/) or MinimServer.

Simple guides for usage in Moode or MinimServer configuration are provided as README files.

For MinimServer usage you might want to read this giude from melius.club user stefano-mbp (in ITALIAN)
